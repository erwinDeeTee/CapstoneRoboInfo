        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">The internet is an amazing tool that lets us learn, play, and connect with others, but it's important to remember to always be safe online. Just like we take precautions in the real world, we also need to be cautious when using the internet.</p>
        <p>One of the most important rules of internet safety is to never share personal information online. This includes your full name, address, phone number, or any other information that could help someone identify you. Always check with a parent or trusted adult before sharing any information online.</p>
        <p>Be careful about the pictures and videos you post online. Once you share something online, it can be difficult to take it back. Always think before you post, and never share pictures or videos that could be embarrassing or hurtful to others.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Be mindful of the websites and apps you visit. Stick to websites and apps that are appropriate for your age and always ask a parent or trusted adult for permission before downloading or installing any new apps or software.</p>
        <p>Never talk to strangers online. It's important to remember that not everyone online may be who they say they are. Avoid chatting with people you don't know in real life, and always let a parent or trusted adult know if someone online makes you uncomfortable.</p>

            <h2>Password Security</h2>
            <img src="webimage/ps.jpg" alt="ps" class="float-right" width="250" height="180">
            <p class="paragraph"> Keep your passwords private. Don't share your passwords with anyone, not even your best friends. Use strong passwords that are hard for others to guess, and change them regularly.</p>

            <p>Password security is important to keep your online accounts safe. Just like you have a key to lock your room and keep it secure, a password is like a virtual key that helps protect your personal information online. When you create a password, make sure it's something that only you know and not something that others can easily guess, like your name or favorite color. It's also a good idea to use a mix of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters, like exclamation marks or hashtags, to make your password stronger. Remember to keep your password a secret and not share it with anyone, even your best friend or family members, unless your parents or a trusted adult tells you it's okay. This way, you can help keep your online accounts safe from hackers or people who may try to access your information without permission.</p>

            <p>Another important aspect of password security is to use a different password for each of your online accounts. Avoid using the same password for all your accounts, like your email, social media, or gaming accounts. If you use the same password for all your accounts and one of them gets hacked, then all your other accounts may also be at risk. It's like having one key for all the doors in your house - if someone gets hold of that key, they can unlock all the doors! So, it's better to use different passwords for different accounts to add an extra layer of protection. If you have trouble remembering multiple passwords, you can use a password manager, which is like a digital safe that stores all your passwords securely. Just make sure to choose a strong master password for your password manager and keep it safe with you or your parents. By following these password security tips, you can help keep your online accounts safe and protect your personal information from unauthorized access.</p>

                <h2>Cyberbullying</h2>
                <img src="webimage/cyber.jpg" alt="cb" class="float-right" width="250" height="150">
                <p class="paragraph">Be cautious with emails and messages. If you receive an email or message from someone you don't know, or if it looks suspicious, don't open it or click on any links. Let a parent or trusted adult know right away.</p>
              
                <p>Avoid cyberbullying. Just like in real life, it's not okay to be mean or hurtful to others online. Treat others with kindness and respect, and if you see someone being bullied online, report it to a trusted adult.</p> 

                <p>Always be respectful online. Be careful about what you say and how you say it. Avoid using hurtful language, and think about how your words might affect others before you post or send a message.</p>

                <p>Talk to a parent or trusted adult about any concerns you have about internet safety. They can help you understand how to stay safe online and provide guidance if you encounter any problems or issues while using the internet. Remember, it's always okay to ask for help when it comes to staying safe online!</p>
