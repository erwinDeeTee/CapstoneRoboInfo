        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Software and applications are important tools that we use on our computers to get things done. Think of them like the tools you might use in your classroom, such as pencils, paper, or scissors. Just like these physical tools, software and applications are digital tools that help us accomplish tasks on our computer.</p>
        <p>One of the great things about software and applications is that they can be used for so many different purposes. For example, you might use a math application to help you practice your multiplication tables, or a language learning application to learn new words and phrases in a foreign language. There are even applications that can help you create music or edit videos!</p>
        <p>However, it's important to remember that not all software and applications are created equal. Some may be more user-friendly than others, or may have different features and capabilities. It's also important to make sure that you download software and applications from trusted sources, to avoid downloading anything that could harm your computer.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">One example of software is an operating system, which is like the "brain" of your computer. It helps manage all the different parts of your computer and allows you to run other programs. Another example of software is a web browser, which is used to access the internet and browse websites.</p>
        <p>Another example of software that elementary students might be familiar with is a game application. Games are a fun way to pass the time, and game applications are designed specifically for playing games on your computer. From puzzle games to adventure games, there are many different types of games available to play on your computer. Some games even teach valuable skills like problem-solving or strategy, while others are just for fun. Either way, game applications are a popular type of software that many elementary students enjoy using on their computers.</p>

            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <img src="webimage/app.jpg" alt="app" class="float-right" width="250" height="150">
            <p class="paragraph"> Applications, on the other hand, are specific programs that you can use for different purposes. For example, you might use a word processor application to write a report or essay, or a drawing application to create a picture or design. There are many different types of applications available, each designed for a specific purpose.</p>

                <img src="webimage/uaf.jpg" alt="uaf" class="float-right" width="250" height="150">
                <p class="paragraph">To use software and applications, you need to interact with them using your computer's keyboard and mouse or touchscreen. For example, you might use your keyboard to type a document in a word processing application or use your mouse to click on buttons in a game.</p>
              
                <p>It's important to remember that different software and applications may require different ways of interacting with them. For example, some applications may be designed to be used with a touchscreen, while others may require a mouse and keyboard. Some applications may even allow you to interact with them using voice commands!</p> 

                <p>In addition to using traditional input devices like a keyboard and mouse, there are also specialized input devices that can be used to interact with software and applications. For example, some people with disabilities may use a special keyboard or mouse that is designed to be easier to use. There are even eye-tracking devices that allow people to control their computer using just their eyes!</p>

                <p>No matter how you choose to interact with software and applications on your computer, it's important to remember that they are tools designed to help you accomplish tasks and achieve your goals. By learning how to use different types of software and applications, you can become more efficient and effective in using your computer.</p>
