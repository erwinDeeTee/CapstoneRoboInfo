        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">A computer is a machine that helps us do many things, like playing games, watching videos, or doing homework. It has different parts that work together to make it work. </p>
        <p>In addition to the tasks you mentioned, computers are also essential tools for businesses, research, and communication. They allow us to access and process vast amounts of information quickly and efficiently, and can perform complex calculations and analyses that would be nearly impossible for humans to do on their own.</p>
        <p>The main components of a computer include the central processing unit (CPU), which is the "brain" of the computer responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations; the random access memory (RAM), which temporarily stores data and instructions that the CPU is currently using; the hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD), which stores data and programs for long-term use; and various input/output devices like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor, which allow users to interact with the computer and see the results of their actions.</p>
        <p>As technology advances, new types of computers and components are constantly being developed, such as tablets, smartphones, and virtual reality systems. These devices often have specialized hardware and software designed for specific tasks, such as gaming, video editing, or medical research. Despite the many variations in form and function, all computers share the fundamental principle of using electronic components to process information and perform tasks.</p>

        <h2>CPU & Memories</h2>
        <img src="webimage/cpu.jpg" alt="cpu" class="float-right" width="150" height="150">
        <p class="paragraph">One of the most important parts of a computer is the central processing unit (CPU). It's like the brain of the computer because it does all the thinking and decision-making. When you tell the computer to do something, the CPU figures out how to make it happen.</p>
        <p>Another important part of a computer is the memory, which is like the computer's short-term memory. It helps the computer remember things that it needs to do right away, like opening a program or running a game. When you turn off the computer, the memory gets erased, which is why you need to save your work before you shut down.</p>  
        <p>The hard drive is like the computer's long-term memory. It stores all the files, pictures, and programs that you save on your computer. When you turn off the computer, the hard drive keeps everything safe so that you can access it again the next time you turn it on.</p>

            <h2>Monitor</h2>
            <img src="webimage/monitor.jpg" alt="monitor" class="float-right" width="250" height="150">
            <p class="paragraph"> the monitor is the part of the computer that lets you see what you're doing. It's like a TV screen, but smaller and meant for looking at things up close. When you move the mouse or type on the keyboard, you can see what you're doing on the monitor.</p>
            <p> and it lets you see all the cool things you can do, like playing games or writing stories. Monitors come in different sizes and shapes, but they all have the same job of showing you what's happening on your computer. So, next time you use a computer, take a look at the monitor and see how it helps you do all sorts of fun things!</p> <div class="blog">

                <h2>Keyboard & Mouse</h2>
                <img src="webimage/keyboard.jpg" alt="keyboard" class="float-right" width="250" height="150">
                <p class="paragraph">Keyboard is like a set of buttons that you use to type words and letters on your computer. It looks like a bunch of tiny pianos, with each button making a different sound on the computer. You can use the keyboard to write stories, send messages to friends, or even play games!</p>
              
                <p>Some keyboards also have special buttons, like volume control or a button to turn the computer on and off. So, next time you use a computer, try typing some words and see what happens!</p> 
                <img src="webimage/mouse.jfif" alt="mouse" class="float-right" width="150" height="100">
                <p>A mouse is a small device that you use to move around on your computer screen. It looks like a small animal, with a button on top that you click to select things on the screen. You can move the mouse up, down, left, and right, and the cursor on the screen will move too. </p>
                <p>This lets you click on buttons, select text, and even play games! Some mice also have a scroll wheel in the middle, which lets you move up and down on a page. So, next time you use a computer, try moving the mouse and see how it helps you do things on the screen!</p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">So, in summary, a computer has a brain called the CPU, short-term memory called memory, long-term memory called the hard drive, and a screen called the monitor. Together, these parts work together to help you do all sorts of cool things on your computer!</p>
                <p>In addition to the CPU, memory, hard drive, and monitor, a computer also has a keyboard for typing words and letters, and a mouse for moving around on the screen and clicking on things. Together, all of these parts work together to help you do all sorts of cool things on your computer!</p>
